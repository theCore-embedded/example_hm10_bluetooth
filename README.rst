    :target: https://travis-ci.org/theCore-embedded/example_hm10_bluetooth

This example demonstrates using of HM-10 Bluetooth module using theCore.
With Bluetooth application on Android device it is possible to establish
communication link between the smartphone and any embedded device with
HM-10 attached.

Detailed description

#. Connect USART2 and power to HM-10_  on the Discovery board using following pins:

   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PA2 (USART2 TX)   | module's RX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PA3 (USART2 RX)   | module's TX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | +3.3V             | module's VDD    |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | GND               | module's GND    |
   +-------------------+-----------------+

#. Attach any preferable UART-to-USB converter `such as this`_ module according to following pinout:

   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PD8 (USART3 TX)   | module's RX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PD9 (USART3 RX)   | module's TX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | GND               | module's GND    |

Installing additional software on Android smartphone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  :alt: BLE Terminal download app
  :align: center

To be able to communicate with HM-10 module via Android smartphone, a special
application must be installed.

Open Play Store and find `BLE Terminal`_ app. Install it as usual.

Preparing
~~~~~~~~~

#. Install and initialize theCore (if not done previously)::

    pip3 install tcore
    tcore bootstrap

#. Download the example::

    tcore init --remote https://github.com/theCore-embedded/example_hm10_bluetooth

#. Step into the project directory::

    cd example_hm10_bluetooth

Building
~~~~~~~~

::

  tcore compile --target tiva_tm4c_launchpad

Running
~~~~~~~

#. Launch `minicom` with device associated with USB <-> UART converter.
   (``/dev/ttyUSB0`` here used as an example)::

        # From new terminal
        tcore runenv "minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0"

   Or the same, but with superuser permissions::

        # From new terminal
        tcore runenv --sudo "minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0"

#. Determine stm32f4discovery board revision.

   If you don't remember your board revision, check FAQ section
   |GET_DISCOVERY_REVISION|

#. Launch ``flash`` command in separate terminal, as shown below.

   For old STM32F407G-DISC boards, with STLINK/V2:

   ::

     tcore flash --sudo


   For new STM32F407G-DISC1 boards, with STLINK/V2.1:

   ::

     tcore flash --sudo --debugger-config stlink-v2.1

#. Check ``minicom`` terminal. You should be able to see::

    :alt: BLE Terminal app main window

#. Select HM-10 device.

#. You will be presented with a terminal window where the data sent from device is displayed

#. Now, type something to the terminal prompt in BLE Terminal app and tap "Send ASCII" button:
